Why are you interested in working at BlackRock and specifically this division?

I initially heard of BlackRock through an alumnus from my school, Max Ramer, and he described the company as the most tech savvy of all the big financial corporations. As someone on the technical side, I appreciate the emphasis that BlackRock places on tech, while maintaining finance as the top priority. When looking into the company further, I could clearly see the time and resources invested in tech from the Aladdin platform, and I would love to work on that, but I am confident that I would enjoy and thrive in any technical role at BlackRock.

I'm also excited by the opportunities BlackRock provides regarding exposure to the company as a whole, through the orientation, speaker series, and opportunity to talk with people in all divisions of the company.

I love technology and coding, and I've always imagined myself applying my programming skills to different industries and fields. I've been interested in fintech for a while, and would love to immerse myself in it at BlackRock next summer to solidify that that's what I want to do, and hopefully return as a full time analyst.
